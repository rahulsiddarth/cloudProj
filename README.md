# MentalHacks-FindMyPal
A web app which connects you with people of similar interest which helps you to take care of your mental health.

## Inspiration
During this pandemic we went through many mental health problem by not contacting with our college mates who are in distant regions
## What it does
It connects people with similar interests near their region and relax their minds according to their interests.

## How we built it
We built it using php, dialogflow, html, css, bootstrap, NLP and bought a domain in **GoDaddy** which is **findmypal.co**
## Challenges we ran into
We struggled hosting it in the heroku and linking it with GoDaddy domain as this is the first time using heroku to connect with GoDaddy. The image was not retrieved in the hosted website due to some SSL configuration we are trying to find out what is wrong there. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We made a complete app which connects people relieve their stress, and we are sure that this will make a great impact.
## What we learned
We learned a bit of NLP and dialogflow and improved our Php skills
## What's next for FindMyPal
Making this recognise worldwide and improve the UI and minor bugs.
